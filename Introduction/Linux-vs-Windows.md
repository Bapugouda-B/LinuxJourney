# Why Linux? 
Linux is powerful and widely-used operating system that has become the backbone of the modern computing world. 

Why Linux is favored by developers, system administrators, and enthusiasis alike:

### 1. Open Source Philosophy
 Linus is buit on the principles of open source software, which means its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

### 2. Stability and Reliability
It can run for extended periods without needing a reboot, making it ideal for servers and critical systems.

### 3. Security
 Linux is inherently secure. Its multi-user and permission based architecture ensure that one user cannot interfere with or damage another users data or processes without proper authorization.

### 4. Customizability
Linux offers incredible flexibility and customization. Users can choose from a wide range of desktop environments, package managers, and software options to tailor their Linux experience. to their specific needs.

### 5. Community support
The Linux community is vibrant and helpful. 

### 6. Cost Efficiency
The Linux is cost effective, as it is free to use and does not require expensive licensing fees.

### 7. Vast Software Ecosystem
Linux boats a vast repository of software packages and libraries, accessible through package managers. This will help to provide tools for development, productivity, gaming and more..

# Linux Architecture
Linux is built on a few key concepts

### 1. Kernel
It is the heart of Linux. It's the part of the oeprating system that communicates directly with our computer's hardware. It manages resources, such a memory and CPU, and ensures different software programs can run without interfering with each other.

### 2. Shell
The shell is like the interface between you(user) and kernel. It takes our commands and communicates them to the kernel, which then carries out the requested actions. 

### 3. File System
Linux uses a hierarchical file system, similar to how you organize files in folders on your computer. Everything in Linux, including hardware devices, is represented as files or directories

### 4. Processes
Linux is a multitasking operating system. It can run multiple processes (programs) simultaneously, managing their execution and resource allocation efficiently.
